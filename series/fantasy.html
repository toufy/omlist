                        the series is a bit slow from season 1 to season 3, but
                        these seasons are essential, and they make up a big part
                        of how rest of the series turned out.<br />
                        there's so much lore, and the story never stops
                        progressing. from season 4 and up, there are no "filler
                        episodes" or empty side-stories.<br />
                        every episode introduces something new that adds to the
                        main plot.<br />
                        the music selection is also really good.
