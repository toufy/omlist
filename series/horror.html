                        it's just me.<br />
                        I haven't watched season 11 (delicate) yet, but
                        apparently people hate it.<br />
                        otherwise the series is pretty good, and even though it
                        does include some of the typical horror movie shticks,
                        they do manage to find their own identifying features
                        that set most of the episodes apart from your typical
                        horror movie. specifically the seamless transition
                        between past and present events.<br />
                        good luck keeping track of who's dead and who's alive,
                        though.
