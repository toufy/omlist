                        >my favorite series. this is a masterpiece.<br />
                        the series highlights the thin line between good and
                        bad, and focuses a lot on the concept of control.<br />
                        elliot and mr. robot's monologues are the best in tv
                        history, and almost all of the other characters, even
                        some secondary ones, have legendary lines.<br />
                        even the antagonists are very lovable, and you can
                        almost sympathize with many of them.<br />
                        it also has the most accurate portrayal of hacking out
                        of any movie or tv show, if we ignore how fast and easy
                        they make the hacks seem.<br />
